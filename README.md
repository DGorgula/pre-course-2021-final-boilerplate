 - multiple item adding seperated by `,` or something else.
 - multiple lists(inspired by Google Keep)
 - tags with colors.
 - delete button that appears on hover.
 - edit task by clicking the text.
 - small 'important' tag.
 - search(filter by text), fast use by ctrl+F.
 - drag & drop to change the order.
 - focus from the beggining on #text-input.
 - press 'Enter' key to add item.
 - menu with important tasks, completed tasks, deleted tasks, and tags tree.
